# Flight Booker

The Flight Booker project from The Odin Project Ruby on Rails track, found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker)

This project demonstrates running queries on multiple models at once using complex forms in the context of booking a one-way flight.
